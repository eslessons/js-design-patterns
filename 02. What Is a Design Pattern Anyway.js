/* What Is a Design Pattern Anyway

Design Patterns:

> Who created them?
> What are they?
> When to use them?
> Where to use them?
> How to implement them?

Design Patterns
To The Rescue

Origins of patterns 
Architect Christopher Alexander 
Book: A Pattern Language. Towns. Buildings. Construction

“...each pattern represents our current
best guess as to what arrangement of
the physical environment will work to
solve the problem presented.”
Christopher Alexander 

“The empirical questions center on
the problem
—does it occur and is it felt in
the way we have described it?”
Christopher Alexander 

“and the solution
—does the arrangement we
propose in fact resolve the problem?”
Christopher Alexander

Design Patterns

|       Problems       |        Solutions         |
- On and Off Traffic    - Cloverleaf Interchanges  
for Highways
- Pedestrian Traffic        - Sidewalks…
- Entry and Exit for     - Revolving Doors
Public Buildings

So, What Constitutes a Pattern?

> It solves a problem
> It is a proven concept
> The solution is not obvious
> It described a relationship
> It has a significant human component

Types Of Patterns

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Creational
1) Constructor
2) Module
3) Factory
4) Singleton

Structural
1) Decorator
2) Façade
3) Flyweight

Behavioral
1) Command
2) Mediator
3) Observer

Rules of the Road

* Objects In JavaScript
* Each Pattern Stands On Its Own
* Describe Each Pattern
* Implement in Node
* Implement in Angular
