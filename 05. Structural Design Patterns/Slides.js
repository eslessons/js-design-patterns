/* Structural Design Patterns

Concerned with how objects are made up and simplify relationships between objects

Structural Patterns
> Deal with the relationship of objects
> Extend functionality
> Simplify functionality

Decorator Pattern
- Used to add new functionality to an existing object,
without being obtrusive. 


+ More complete inheritance
+ Wraps an object
+ Protects existing objects
+ Allows extended functionality



Façade Pattern
Used to provide a simplified interface to a complicated
system

Think about the front of a building
Facade hides the chaos from us
Simplifies the interface
Think JQuery




Flyweight Pattern
Conserves memory by sharing portions of an object
between objects. 

Our tasks had lots of non unique data
Flyweight shares data across objects
Results in a smaller memory footprint
Like a boxer --- a flyweight….
But only if you have large numbers of
objects
